#Instructions
#Use a new branch to create each method (i.e. addition method is created on the addition branch)
#Partner 1 builds addition and division methods
#Partner 2 builds subtration and multiplication methods
#Work independently and at the same time
#Use the cylce for pushing  a branch


def add (n1,n2)
  n1 + n2
